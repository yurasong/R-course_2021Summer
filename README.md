# R-course_2021Summer

## Introduction

This R coursework repository is for the members of Blanpain lab, who would like to start using R. This directory includes a set of practice with several example data and detailed topics.

The purposes of this R coursework are
  - To be familiar with R functions and packages
  - To understand how to deal with the data
  - To visualize the characteristic of data propoerly
  - To perform downstream analysis with the R packages

It is highly recommended to open on the laptop or desktop, rather than mobile. Readability is not so good on mobile and it is easy to practice directly on your R session of laptop or desktop.

Please do not copy the contents or use it as the material of course in schools. Also, Please do not share it with others.

## Contents

In each folder, there will be
- .Rmd : R notebook, which you could open on your RStudio and run the code by yourself.
- .html : R notebook, which is knitted and available on the chrome or safari.
- .csv/.tsv : example data for practice.

In some case, the practice may not have example data. In this case, the built-in dataset has been used for practice. Usually the example data is available on excel sheet, since most of the dataset would be tab- (.tsv) or comma-deliminated (.csv) files.

## Issues or Inqueries

If you have any question or suggestion _regarding the coursework_, feel free to bring your laptop to the office of Yura.
